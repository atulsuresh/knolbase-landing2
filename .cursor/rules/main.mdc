# 🧠 Knolbase — AI-Powered Onboarding & Training Platform for B2B Software Teams

## 🎯 Context

Knolbase helps **product and onboarding teams at B2B software companies** personalize user training at scale using AI.  
It’s built for teams that manage **complex, multi-persona onboarding processes** where every customer account has different roles, workflows, and expectations.

The platform automates the creation and delivery of **role-based, account-specific training experiences** so that users reach “time-to-value” faster — without requiring large manual onboarding teams.

## ⚙️ Problem

Modern B2B products — especially in industries like healthcare, finance, or supply chain — face significant friction in user onboarding:

- Onboarding teams rely on **manual training** (calls, sheets, docs, webinars).
- Different **user personas** (admin, manager, operator, etc.) require different workflows.
- Change management is a **major adoption blocker** — users resist or distrust new systems.
- This leads to:
  - Long implementation cycles
  - High training backlog
  - Poor personalization
  - Increased support load
  - Churn and missed revenue opportunities
